24th December 2019, today I started installing react native on my windows machine. 
After many tries I could not succefully tested app on emulator with out using Expo. So finally, I tried using Expo but intially it was
also failing.
When I selected android emulator Metro Bundler was crashing with following error.
---
Metro Bundler process exited with code 1
Set EXPO_DEBUG=true in your env to view the stack trace.
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE
npm ERR! errno 1
npm ERR! @ start: `expo start`
npm ERR! Exit status 1
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Failed at the @ start script.
npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.

Then I searched on stackoverflow and found some nice way to handle it.
1. Open \node_modules\metro-config\src\defaults\blacklist.js file from your app.
2. Update following code
var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[/\\]react[/\\]dist[/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];
To following code
var sharedBlacklist = [
  /node_modules[\/\\]react[\/\\]dist[\/\\].*/,
  /website\/node_modules\/.*/,
  /heapCapture\/bundle\.js/,
  /.*\/__tests__\/.*/
];
3. Save and open command terminal =>cd Your Project path && expo start

DONE!!!
